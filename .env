# Rork API Base URL (for tRPC and backend API calls)
# This is the base URL of your Rork app (without /api)
EXPO_PUBLIC_RORK_API_BASE_URL=https://mndoykxznn8upi25s7wjk.rork.app

# OpenAI Proxy URL (points to your backend's /api/chat endpoint)
# For Rork projects with backend enabled, the backend is accessible at the same origin as the frontend
# When running locally with Rork, the backend is at the tunnel URL + /api
# When deployed, it's at your production URL + /api

# For web (React Native Web), we auto-detect the origin
# For mobile, you need to set this to your Rork tunnel URL or production URL
# Example: https://mndoykxznn8upi25s7wjk.rork.app/api
EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_PROXY_URL=https://mndoykxznn8upi25s7wjk.rork.app/api

# Backend API Key (server-side only, never exposed to client)
# This should be set in your Rork project environment variables
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
